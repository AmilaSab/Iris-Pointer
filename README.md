# Iris-Pointer

Using an eye in interaction with computers has attracted a lot of attention, so plenty of different methods were developed for that use. Most of those are restricted by ambient conditions, user's facial expression, and using invasive methods that can affect human health. This project strives to develop an approach that will avoid mentioned methods, and focus on creating a device that will be as simple as possible for using as an eye tracker. The target group are people with cognitive disorders, so the device was developed bearing that in mind. Using noninvasive method for eye tracking is based on image processing, which is explained in this work, along with the way of deciding what type of hardware should be used, extraction of region of interest, and estimation of iris position based on processed image. Results and review of used approaches are given, as well as possible improvements and solutions of existing problems.
